Submission for 2025 Lifeline Datathon organized by MLDA@EEE

## Project Description
A python-based machine learning project designed to provide reliable and interpretable classification of fetal health states from cardiotocography (CTG) data for clinical use.\
Applies Histogram-based Gradient Boosting (HGB) to classify fetal cardiotocography (CTG) data into three categories:
1. Normal – Healthy fetal heart rate patterns
2. Suspect – Borderline or unclear patterns
3. Pathologic – Abnormal patterns indicating potential fetal distress

After comparing 3 models, HGB was chosen because it gave the most accurate results, trained faster than the others, and made fewer false negatives when detecting pathologic cases.

  ### Our program follows the workflow:
  * Data visualization and relationship mapping
  * Seperating data into training and test subsets
  * Measuring performance with confusion matrix, balanced accuracy, and macro-F1

## Project Folders/Files:
Data Exploration: past experiments with different models\
Demo results: .pkl files (trained model files) and graphics from demo video\
sample_input: csv files for training, description of features (json)\
TM110_Test: to be run after training is complete\
TM110_Training: initial code for model training

## Instructions to Run Program
Alternatively, watch the [demo video.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tIZ33oVbeFAIEMUaVBGm4qr6vyt5vOdC?usp=sharing)
1. Download TM110_Training.py and TM110_Test.py and put into one folder
2. Open a terminal and move to the folder.
3. Run TM110_Training.py. Two pkl files and two csv files should be created in the folder.
4. Run the following command to test the model: ```TM110_Test.py --input input [--model model] [--output output]```
    * Input: The CTG data to be inputted. Required. Accepted file type: .xlsx, .xls, .csv
    * Model: The machine learning model to be used. Optional. Options: HGB_NSP.pkl or HGB_CLASS.pkl
    * Output: Where to save the predictions result. Optional. Default: predictions.csv

## Resources
All models were trained on the open-source CTG dataset provided by the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/193/cardiotocography)
